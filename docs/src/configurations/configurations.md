# Configurations

The configurations objects centralize the main ingredients of astrophysical problems in Skylight.jl: the spacetime, the radiative model, and the camera. Additionally, it contains information to completely determine the geometrized code units together with the $c = G = 1$ conditions. 



## Example




emitter to observer is no fully implemented in the code
which are in vacuum, examples 

#### Units
Mention unit will change soon to ensure consistent treatment
